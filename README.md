# PIT4U

PIT4U is a Plugin for IntelliJ to help you run mutation testing using [PIT](http://pitest.org).

## Where?

You can find it available on [Jetbrains Marketplace](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/25570-pit4u)

## Why?

I created this plugin because the [reference plugin](https://github.com/mjedynak/pit-idea-plugin) by Michal Jedynak (
thank you for that amazing plugin) seems to be abandoned, and its latest version is using deprecated APIs that is
causing IntelliJ to freeze and report errors when using it. I also plan on add new features that, at the time of
writing, don't exist in the aforementioned plugin.

## Roadmap

Here you will find the ideas I have for this plugin.

### Features

- Add context-aware action
- Parse results and show them in the IDE directly

### Small improvements

- Review & fix validations in `Other parameters` table

## Donations

TBD
