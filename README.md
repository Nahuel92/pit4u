# PIT4U

PIT4U is an Plugin for IntelliJ to help you run mutation testing using [PIT](http://pitest.org).

## Why?

I created this plugin because the [reference plugin](https://github.com/mjedynak/pit-idea-plugin) seems to be abandoned.

## Roadmap

- [x] Create MVP
- [ ] Publish beta version
- [ ] Add context-aware action
- [ ] Fix validations in `Other params` table
- [ ] Parse results and show them in the IDE directly

## Donations

TBD
